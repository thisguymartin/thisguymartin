### Hi, I'm Martin. 👋🏻 👾

I am a developer who loves to build and experiment with new technologies and always up for a challenge. Most of my professional dev career has been around `node`, `vue`, `react`, `python`, `java`, and `AWS`. 

- 💬  I am currently learning Go and .NET and getting more into the Microsoft just to be more badass. 

- My goal is to be a jedi/witcher engineer that can kick ass.
